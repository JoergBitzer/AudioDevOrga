# AudioDevOrga
This repository is the starting point to learn plugin development with JUCE

# Start

1. make a new directory (I would recommend just below home or c:/d: ). I usually use AudioDev
2. cd into this directory and clone this repository

# Requirements to learn plugin development

1. Have some basic understanding of C++ (you will learn more during the development process)
2. Have some basic understanding of your tools (compiler (gcc, xCode or VS), git)
3. Understand the legal aspects if you develop with JUCE

# Some remarks

1. I am not a professional c++ developer (I was, a long time ago with a focus on signal processing)
2. I am sure, lots of people will show you the development process in a different and perhaps better way. However, I assure you, my way will give you some help at the beginning and navigate around some pitfalls on the way, especially if you are interested in platform independent design.
3. no strings, no costs and no responsibility from my side attached.
