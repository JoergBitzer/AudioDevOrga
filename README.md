# AudioDevOrga
This repository is the starting point to learn plugin development with JUCE.
It is still subject to change and in a developing phase

So far:
1. the installation process for the toolchain is described
2. a template is provided (resizable and with a preset handler)
3. several examples are provided

Missing:
1. a tutorial, how to start a new plugin
2. improved HowTo.md


# Start

1. make a new directory (I would recommend just below home or c:/d: ). I usually use AudioDev
2. cd into this directory and clone this repository
3. read ``installReadMe.md``

# Requirements to learn plugin development

1. Have some basic understanding of C++ (you will learn more during the development process)
2. Have some basic understanding of your tools (compiler (gcc, xCode or VS), git, cmake)
3. Understand the legal aspects if you develop with JUCE

# Some remarks

1. I am not a professional c++ developer (I was, a long time ago with a focus on signal processing). So, please forgive me, if I am at some points not at th edge of c++ development. My code is developed for learning purposes not optimality. However, the final plugins will be on a professional level.
2. I am sure, lots of people will show you the development process in a different and perhaps better way. However, I assure you, my way will give you some help at the beginning and navigate around some pitfalls on the way, especially if you are interested in platform independent design.
3. No strings, no costs and no responsibility from my side attached.
