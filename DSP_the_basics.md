# Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

The concept involves creating some videos based on this file, possibly including some figures to explain the fundamentals of DSP. This is not a comprehensive course on signal and system theory, but rather an overview of the basics necessary to understand why we implement things the way we do.

This is work in progress:

## Sampling and Samplingrate (Differences between analog and digital signals)

## time-domain processing (linear time-invariant (LTI))

### fir filter

### iir filter

## frequency domain processing (LTI)

### dft

### stft

## signal depending processing

### peak vs. RMS


## non-linear processing

### aliasing

### oversampling
